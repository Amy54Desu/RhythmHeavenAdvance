If you want to change the font, then hear me out:

- The ".fnt" is a "Rhythm Tengoku only" format that can be opened with
CrystalTile2 with the following settings:
- width: 16
- height: 12
- Tile format: Rhythm Heaven(only)

- The "spacing.bin" is a simple binary file that contains the width of every
character in the ".fnt" file in order.
