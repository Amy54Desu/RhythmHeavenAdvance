Those tools have no documentation and were created by various people at multiple years interval, some of them really are trial-and-error.

However from what I remember:
- RhythmHeavenOAMEditor: It's in the name.
- Rhythm Tengoku Compression: Decompressor for Rhythm Tengoku.
- R-IQ Tile Fixer: Reassemble BG from their tile arrangement and vice-versa.
- gfxLocator.lua: VERY useful script to locate OAM and Sprite into the ROM. (Only works with the log flag in the compile.asm file)
